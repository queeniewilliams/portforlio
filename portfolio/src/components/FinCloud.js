              The expense tracker aims to assist a user in managing personal
              finances by offering not only a basic expense check but also a
              brief analysis of incomes and expenses. All operations are
              performed in private through a personal account. <br />
              <br />
              The project is a MERN stack application, deployed on Heroku. The
              front-end was developed in HTML5, CSS3, and React.js while the
              back-end was created in Express and Node.js. The data was stored
              in MongoDB Atlas and users can only access their own data but
              otherâ€™s

          <br />
          <br />
          Add/ Edit/ Delete a transaction: The user can create a new income or
          expense transaction which can be deleted or modified after the
          creation.
          <br />
          <br />
          Check recent transactions: The user will see all transactions took
          place in the last three days and the sum of income, expense and
          balance in the personal dashboard.
          <br />
          <br />
          Check history transactions: The user can also check the list of
          previous transactions along with the sum and ratio of income and
          expense in a day, a week, a month and a year.
          <br />
          <br />
          Get an overview of incomes and expenses: All transactions of the user
          are accumulated to the daily, weekly and monthly total sum and
          visualized as a histogram. The user then gets a better understanding
          of the weekly, monthly and yearly fluctuation of incomes and expenses.
